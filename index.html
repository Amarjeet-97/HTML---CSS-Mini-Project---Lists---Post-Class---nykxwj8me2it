        <h2>Golden Temple Amritsar</h2>
        <p>
            The Golden Temple is an open house of worship for all people, from all walks of life and faiths.
            It has a square plan with four entrances, and a circumambulation path around the pool. The four
            entrances to the gurudwara symbolises the Sikh belief in equality and the Sikh view that all people 
            are welcome into their holy place.[14] The complex is a collection of buildings around the sanctum 
            and the pool.[3] One of these is Akal Takht, the chief centre of religious authority of Sikhism.
            Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of the Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and 
            a langar – a free Sikh community–run kitchen that offers a vegetarian meal to all visitors without 
            discrimination.[5] Over 150,000 people visit the holy shrine everyday for worship.
             The Gurdwara complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is 
             pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.

        <h2>Buland Darwaja</h2>
        <p>
            The Buland Darwaza is made of red and buff sandstone, decorated by white and black marble and is higher 
            than the courtyard of the mosque. The Buland Darwaza is symmetrical and is topped by large free-standing
            kiosks, which are the chhatris. It also has terrace edge gallery kiosks on the roof, stylised 
            
            buckler-battlements, small minor-spires, and inlay work with white and black marble. On the outside, 
            a long flight of steps sweeps down the hill giving the gateway additional height. It is 40 meters high 
            and 51 meters from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 meters from the ground 
            level. It is a 15-storied high gateway acting as the southern entrance of the city of Fatehpur Sikri.
             The approach to the gate consists of 42 steps.[6] It is semi-octagonal in plan with two smaller 
             triple-storeyed wings on either side. It has three kiosks on its top surrounded by thirteen 
             smaller domed kiosks. There are smaller turrets surrounding the gateway.[4][5] The expanse is broken by 
             arched niches, small laudas , and marbles which highlights the courtyard of the Jama Masjid. The principal 
             arch stands in the centre of three projecting sides and topped by a dome. The central arch is broken into three
              tiers with rows of smaller arches and flat brackets.[7]

            The great gate itself is plain. The three horizontal panels of buff stone noticeable in the Badshahi Darwaza are also present
            here. The plain red sandstone spandrels are framed in white marble with a flower-like ornament inlaid in 
            white marble at the apex of the arch, and a flattish rosette, centered with the narrow panel above it, on 
            either side. The cusped ornament, large and bold in fact, but small and delicate when seen from below, is carried down
            below the springing of the arch. Two pieces have been broken off from the left hand side and eight from the right. The arch 
            has three actual openings bordered by decorative panels and superimposed by three other arched openings crowned by a semi-dome.
            The total height of the Gate above the pavement is 176  ft.

            A Persian inscription on the eastern archway of the Buland Darwaza records Akbar's conquest of 
            Uttar Pradesh and the victory in Gujarat in 1573.

        <h2>Mahabodhi Temple</h2>
        <p>
            The Mahabodhi Temple (literally: "Great Awakening Temple") or the Mahābodhi Mahāvihāra, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, 
            is an ancient, but rebuilt and restored Buddhist temple in Bodh Gaya, Bihar, India, marking the location where the Buddha
             is said to have attained enlightenment.[1] Bodh Gaya is 15 km from Gaya and is about 96 km (60 mi) from Patna.

            The site contains a descendant of the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha gained enlightenment, and has been a major pilgrimage 
            destination of Buddhists for well over two thousand years, and some elements date to the period of Ashoka (died c. 232 BCE).
             What is now visible on the ground essentially dates from the 5th century CE, or possibly earlier, as well as several major 
             restorations since the 19th century. But the structure now may well incorporate large parts of earlier work, possibly from 
             the 2nd or 3rd century CE.[2] Archaeological finds from the site however, indicate that the place was a site of veneration 
             for Buddhists since at least the Mauryan period.[3] In particular, the Vajrasana, which is located within the temple itself 
             has been dated to the third century BCE.[4]
